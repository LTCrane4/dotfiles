# Dotfiles

This is a repo for dotfiles. Note that the setup scripts aren't working right now

## vim

The vim configuration I use is contained in the `vim` folder, as well as in `.vimrc` in the root directory of the repo.
These can be symlinked to from a `home` directory so that updates from this repo will reflect into those places

## Required package

A few other packages are required to use this configuration without error

* vim - obviously with the packages outlined in the vim directory.
* [Powerline Bash](https://github.com/abhijitvalluri/bash-powerline-shell), for the user PS1
